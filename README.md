# Hillarious Redux Tutorial

I started off from this exapmle:

https://redux.js.org/advanced/async-actions

I boiled it down and reduced the effective code by over half. The example is unreadable, obfuscated, and totally inept. The entire worth of Redux can be summed up on their front page. Asynchrenous requests and loading time is not a concern for front-end react apps. If you disable wifi and let the API calls "load" forever, you can still interact with the UI and state and past events.

Javascript developers are fucking retarded. All of Redux can be replaced by using a single global object. People don't even like singletons anyway.

Cheers.
